# pcl-classify

## The repository

Full results and figures are available in their respective folders.

## Preparing to run the code

If you're a member of the CS 4650 teaching staff, the data for the PCL can be accessed from the Dropbox link submitted with the final report.

If you're researcher from another institution, you can request access to the SemEval 2022 Task 4 dataset via a form provided by the organizers: https://forms.gle/VN8hwbdGYkf5KHiKA

## Running the code

The jupyter notebook file, CS_4650_Final_Project.ipynb, can be run in its entirety and will demonstrate SVM models as well as the train and validation loop for DistilBERT or BERT. 

CS_4650_Final_Project.ipynb can be uploaded to google colab for training on a GPU.
